<h1>Pi-Powered VPN Client Gateway</h1>
The VPN Client Gateway forwards network traffic through a Virtual Private Network connection. To facilitate geospoofing for media streaming, it includes a management web page that allows you to switch VPN servers by simply clicking on a country flag.

To build your own VPN Client Gateway you will need a Raspberry Pi (or similar lightweight Linux computer) and a Private Internet Access account.

The project files can be download from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mr-canoehead/vpn_client_gateway/releases).

The [Installation Guide](https://github.com/mr-canoehead/vpn_client_gateway/wiki/Installation-Guide) can be found in the project wiki. A PDF version
 of the guide is included with the project files.

Here is a screenshot showing the management web page:
