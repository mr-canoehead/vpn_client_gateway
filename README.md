<h1>Pi-Powered VPN Client Gateway</h1>
The VPN Client Gateway forwards network traffic through a Virtual Private Network connection. To facilitate geospoofing for media streaming, it includes a management web page that allows you to switch VPN servers by simply clicking on a country flag.

To build your own VPN Client Gateway you will need a Raspberry Pi (or similar lightweight Linux computer) and a [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com), [PureVPN](https://www.purevpn.com/), [Newshosting](https://www.newshosting.com/), or [NordVPN](https://www.nordvpn.com) VPN account.

The project files can be download from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mr-canoehead/vpn_client_gateway/releases) or by [downloading the repository zip file](https://github.com/mr-canoehead/vpn_client_gateway/archive/master.zip).

The [Installation Guide](https://github.com/mr-canoehead/vpn_client_gateway/wiki/Installation-Guide) can be found in the project wiki.

Here is a screenshot showing the management web page:
